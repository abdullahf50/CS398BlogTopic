      <div>Machine learning is used in self-driving cars where the technology predicts and calculates what is surrounding the car 
        and stops and goes based on the calculations and images being read by the technology. Although it might not be safe to let 
        a car drive itself it can help when a driver falls asleep or something unexpected happens. You cannot rely on this technology 
        when the road conditions are not good or the lanes are not visible during winter or other severe weather conditions. Some ways 
        the technology works are capturing videos of its surrounding and motion and distance sensors in the car itself.</div>


        <div>The way self driving cars make decisions is that it can identify objects, interpret situations based on identifying what that 
        object is and through object classification algorithms it knows it’s surroundings. A company named Mindy support provides data 
        annotation and this can help with machine learning algorithms which in turn can make the right decisions most of the time 
        depending on the road conditions and other factors. Self driving cars use many algorithms used together to minimize the mistakes 
        and ensure safety of the car and the people. These algorithms can identify objects such as lanes, road signs, and recognize other 
        types of roads through images and interpreting data it is reading and identifying crossroads and other things even humans might not be 
        able to see or pay attention to. This makes machine learning a powerful technology but it is still not better than actual humans
         driving the cars. </div>
        
        
        <div>The way a self driving car uses machine learning to see its surroundings is through three major sensors which are cameras, radars, 
        and lidars. These three sensors work together to act as eyes and brains similar to humans. These sensors identify locations, speed, 
        shapes and also some self-driving cars have inertial measurement units that monitor and control acceleration and locations of the 
        car 
        and its surroundings. There are cameras at every important angle of the car to capture its surroundings for almost perfect accuracy. 
        Some of the cameras can cover large locations and some of them cover small fields of view. Radar detectors support bad driving
         conditions and low visibility that causes the cameras to not be able to see. This makes machine learning more powerful than humans 
         because if we can’t see, we cannot determine what is near us. These detectors send a pulse of radio waves to locate an object and 
         send information about the speed and location of the object. The other sensor Lidar calculates distance through pulsed lasers
          which 
         provides richer 3D visuals of the car’s surroundings. LIDAR is one of the most important technologies in self-driving cars.
          It basically sends pulses of light that bounces off of an object creating an image and presenting the surrounding of the car
           like seeing with your eyes. </div>


        <div>Some of the applications of machine learning in self-driving cars include localization in space and mapping, sensor fusion and 
        scene comprehension, navigation and movement planning, and evaluation of a driver’s state and recognition of a driver’s behavior 
        patterns. Self driving cars can use a machine learning method called M2I that takes two inputs, past trajectory of the cars cyclists, 
        and people in a four way street to determine who has the right of way based on arrival time of other vehicles and giving the right of 
        way to pedestrians and cyclists. </div>


         <div>One of the most popular companies that produces self driving cars, Tesla, does not use LIDAR, instead, they are using Hydranet, 
         which is a network of eight cameras all over the vehicle and Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies makes all 
         the cameras work together to capture all the images in order to see its surroundings. The reason Tesla won’t use LiDAR is because
          it is a big object that is placed on the roof of the car and this doesn’t sit well with the design of Tesla which promotes simple 
          design that avoids all bulky objects inside or outside the car similar to an iphone vs old phones with a lot of buttons. </div>


         
               <div>The way the machine learning algorithms work consists of different sections of AI, one of them is supervised vs unsupervised. 
             Unsupervised learning is when a machine learning algorithm receives unlabeled data and no instructions on  how to process it, it 
             has to figure it out on its own. On the other hand the supervised learning model, the algorithm takes instructions on how to interpret
             the input data. This is what most self-driving cars use because it allows the algorithm to evaluate training data based on a fully
             labeled dataset, this makes this learning model more useful especially for classification. One of the algorithms used is SIFT which
             stands for scale-invariant feature transform, it detects objects and interprets images. For example on a square object the four
             points of the object are entered as features. Another algorithm is AdaBoost for data classification. This algorithm collects data 
             and classifies it to boost the learning process and performance of vehicles. It does so by collecting a lot of data so that the
             accuracy is enhanced. Another one is HOG(histogram of oriented gradients), which analyzes an object’s location and identifies
             how the object moves and changes. YOLO (you only look once), is an algorithm that detects and groups objects like humans, trees, and vehicles. This algorithm is best
             for identifying and grouping objects. </div>


                  <div> Overall, machine learning in self-driving cars make it possible for cars to see what surrounds it and makes decisions on how to move,
              which makes the job of humans easy, because they can rely on this technology to keep the, safe when they fall asleep by accident or
              need this technology to let go of the wheel for a little bit. It is the future of transportation. With more safety features and
              other improved technologies added, self-driving cars will be the future of transportation and other things. I had fun reading 
              about all the technologies that produce self-driving cars that I hope to drive someday in the future of cars.</div>
